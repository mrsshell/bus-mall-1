This script will generate three random images from the pool of twenty provided
and display them to the user. These images are all buttons. When the user clicks
on one, the script will keep count of which item was clicked and how many total times
it has been clicked. Each click also has the effect of generating three new
different random images from the pool for the user to choose from.
The script also keeps a running count of how many times
each image has been displayed to the user. After the user has clicked on 25 images,
the script generates an unordered list displaying all the above data that was gathered.
